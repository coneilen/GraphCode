# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository. Read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first; everything there — licensing, the
[DCO](DCO) sign-off, and the pull request expectations — applies here too.

## Overview

GraphCode ships on macOS and is being ported to Windows.

- **macOS is the primary, shipping platform.** The app (`graphcode/`), daemon
  (`graphcoded/`), and CLI (`graphcode-cli/`) are built with Xcode through
  Tuist, driven by the root `Makefile`.
- **Windows is the in-progress port chasing parity.** It lives in
  `graphcode-windows/` and is written in Zig, with its own pinned toolchain and
  its own bootstrap script.
- **`GraphcodeKit/` is shared Swift** used by both.

Telling platforms apart by path:

| Path | Platform |
| --- | --- |
| `graphcode/`, `graphcoded/`, `graphcode-cli/`, `Project.swift`, `Tuist/`, `Makefile` | macOS |
| `graphcode-windows/`, `Tools/windows/`, `windows-tests/` | Windows |
| `GraphcodeKit/`, `Package.swift`, `Package.resolved` | Shared Swift |
| `investigation/` | Research notes and the parity ledger |

Work on the platform your task names. Do not "fix" the other platform in
passing.

## Shared rules

These apply to every change, on either platform.

### Sign-off and pull requests

- Sign off every commit (`git commit -s`); the DCO check is required. Keep
  commit messages UTF-8 with LF endings.
- Fill in [the pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md),
  including its checklist, and state the test plan's limits honestly.
- Keep one change per pull request, and describe the problem it solves rather
  than the files it touches.
- Keep changes scoped to the files your task owns. Several agents work in
  parallel across this repo, and overlapping edits to shared surfaces such as
  `App.zig`, `GraphModel.zig`, `NativeForms.zig`, and `GraphStore.swift` need
  explicit coordination.
- Never force-push a branch another session owns, and never bypass required
  checks.

### The RED/GREEN/REGRESSION gate

`.github/workflows/tdd-evidence.yml` runs `Tools/tdd/Test-TddEvidence.ps1`
against the pull request body on every open, edit, synchronize, and reopen. The
body must contain literal `RED:`, `GREEN:`, and `REGRESSION:` lines. Each one
must be at least 8 characters, must use `command -> result` form, and must not
contain an angle-bracket placeholder or the words TODO, TBD, or N/A. There is
no exemption, so write the lines from commands you actually ran.

This mirrors the working practice: write the test, observe it fail for the
intended reason, then implement, then re-run something wider. Preserve the
failing output rather than replacing it with the passing run.

### Evidence honesty

Overstated evidence has repeatedly caused rework. Be exact about what you ran.

- Distinguish a **compile** failure (a missing API) from a **behavioral**
  failure. A compile error is not proof of runtime behavior.
- Never overwrite a failing log with a passing one, and never fold a corrected
  mistake silently into a success summary.
- A green build, a filtered test run, or a green CI workflow does **not**
  establish native keyboard input, accessibility conformance, real glyph
  rendering, daemon persistence, cross-platform parity, or hardware behavior
  unless that exact path ran.
- A manually dispatched workflow run is not the same as a pull request's
  required checks.

### The parity ledger

[investigation/ui-parity-matrix.md](investigation/ui-parity-matrix.md) is the
Windows UI parity ledger. It is a source-derived completion ledger, not a
requirements sketch: a row is `Validated` only when the Windows implementation
exposes the same user-visible information and actions as macOS *and* has runtime
evidence. When your evidence is a build or a unit test rather than a live
walkthrough, the row stays `Partial`.

### Sandbox hygiene

Use your own scratch, cache, config, and build directories, and redirect
`TEMP`/`TMP` where applicable. Never write into another worktree's or session's
build directory; treat other sessions' artifacts as strictly read-only.

## macOS

### Prerequisites

`make doctor` is the macOS entry point. Unlike the Windows bootstrap it
**installs nothing** — it checks every build prerequisite and prints the exact
fix for anything missing:

```sh
make doctor
```

It reports on `mise`, `tuist`, installed Tuist dependencies, `swiftlint`,
`xcbeautify`, the Swift toolchain, Xcode, `Project.swift`, the
`ThirdParty/ghostty` and `ThirdParty/zmx` submodules, a zig-linkable macOS 15
SDK, the Metal toolchain, and the built `zmx` and `GhosttyKit.xcframework`.

Typical first-run sequence, following what `doctor` asks for:

```sh
brew install mise
mise install                      # pinned tools from mise.toml
git submodule update --init --recursive
mise exec -- tuist install        # Tuist/SwiftPM dependencies
```

Pinned tool versions live in `mise.toml`: `tuist` 4.197.3, `swiftlint` 0.65.0,
`xcbeautify` 3.2.1, and `zig` 0.15.2. Apple's `swift-format` ships with the
Xcode toolchain and is deliberately not pinned there. The `Makefile` runs the
pinned tools through `mise exec --`; do the same rather than calling a tool
straight off `PATH`.

### Building, testing, and linting

The Xcode project is generated, not committed: `make generate` runs
`tuist generate --no-open` against `Project.swift`, producing
`graphcode.xcworkspace`. The schemes are `graphcode` (app), `graphcoded`
(daemon), and `graphcode-cli`, all built for `platform=macOS`.

```sh
make build-app        # or build-daemon / build-cli
make run-app          # builds, installs zmx, then opens graphcode.app
make test             # xcodebuild test for the graphcode scheme
make check            # swiftlint lint + swift format lint --strict
make format           # swift format --in-place + swiftlint --fix
```

`make check` and `make format` use `.swiftlint.yml` for SwiftLint and
`.swift-format` for the formatter, across `GraphcodeKit`, `graphcode`,
`graphcode-cli`, and `graphcoded`.

Other targets worth knowing: `install-zmx`, `build-ghostty`, `vendor-sdk`,
`install-cli`, `daemon-install` / `daemon-uninstall` / `daemon-status`,
`release-dmg`, `notarize`, `signing-doctor`, and the `dev-*` family for a
side-by-side local-development install.

### The macOS toolchain trap: the Zig SDK shim

Zig 0.15.2 cannot link against macOS SDK 26.x. That SDK dropped the plain
`arm64-macos` target from the primary `libSystem` document in
`usr/lib/libSystem.B.tbd`, leaving only `arm64e-macos`. Zig targets `arm64`,
finds no matching target, and concludes libSystem exports nothing — so every
libc symbol comes back undefined. Apple's own linker falls back from `arm64` to
`arm64e`; Zig 0.15.2's self-hosted MachO linker does not. The failure is not
specific to this repository: even `zig build --help` fails the same way.

Zig has no `SDKROOT` support and resolves the SDK by shelling out to exactly
`xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path`. `Tools/zig-sdk-shim/xcrun` intercepts that
one query, answers it with a macOS 15 SDK, and delegates everything else to the
real `xcrun`. The `Makefile` prepends the shim to `PATH` for every Zig build, so
`make build-zmx` and `make build-ghostty` already do the right thing. If you
invoke Zig directly on macOS, do the same:

```sh
PATH="$PWD/Tools/zig-sdk-shim:$PATH" zig build ...
```

The shim resolves its SDK from `GRAPHCODE_ZIG_SDK` if set, then a vendored
`.build/sdk/MacOSX15*.sdk` (see `make vendor-sdk`), then the newest
`MacOSX15*.sdk` in the Command Line Tools. Read the script's header before
changing any of this — installing a second, older Xcode is *not* required.

`make build-ghostty` additionally needs the Metal toolchain
(`xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`), and both Zig builds pass
`-Doptimize` deliberately: a Debug `zmx` relays about 0.3 MB/s and is not usable
for interactive work.

### Local overrides

The `Makefile` does `-include .env` then `-include .env.local`, so `.env.local`
wins when both exist, and command-line assignments (`make run-app FOO=bar`) beat
both. Both files are gitignored; `.env.example` is tracked and documents the
`DEV_*` variables used by the `dev-*` targets. Keep credentials out of them.

### macOS CI

`.github/workflows/macos-shared-regression.yml` runs on `macos-26` for every
pull request. It checks out submodules recursively, runs
`python3 Tools/portable-prepare.py`, installs mise and the pinned tools, runs
`swift test --package-path investigation/spikes/swift-portable`, then
`tuist install`, `make install-zmx`, `make test`, and `make check`.

## Windows

### Bootstrap before anything else

**Do not hand-roll a toolchain environment, and do not install toolchains by
hand.** The repository already pins and resolves everything:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File Tools\windows\bootstrap.ps1
```

It installs the pinned Swift, downloads both pinned Zig versions, clones each
pinned provider and checks it out at its pinned commit, and writes
`.graphcode-tools\environment.ps1`. Bootstrap does not build the providers —
they are built later by the build and test tasks, which pass the provider roots
in (for example `-Dwinghostty-dir`).
Load that script in each new shell:

```powershell
. .\.graphcode-tools\environment.ps1
```

It exports the variables the build and test scripts expect:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GRAPHCODE_SWIFT633` | Full path to the pinned `swift.exe` |
| `GRAPHCODE_ZIG0152` | Zig 0.15.2, for the Windows shell |
| `GRAPHCODE_ZIG0160` | Zig 0.16.0, required only by `zmx` |
| `GRAPHCODE_WINGHOSTTY_ROOT` | Pinned Winghostty provider root |
| `GRAPHCODE_ZMX_ROOT` | Pinned zmx provider root |

Pass `-SkipSwift` when you only need Zig and the providers; `-ToolRoot` and
`-ProviderRoot` relocate the tool and provider directories if the defaults
(`.graphcode-tools` and `.graphcode-tools\providers`) do not suit your session.

### Pinned versions

These are the single source of truth. Never silently upgrade one.

| Tool | Version | Pinned in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Swift | 6.3.3 | `.github/workflows/windows-*.yml` (`swift-version: swift-6.3.3-release`), `Tools/windows/bootstrap.ps1` |
| Zig (shell) | 0.15.2 | `mise.toml`, `graphcode-windows/build.zig.zon` (`minimum_zig_version`) |
| Zig (zmx only) | 0.16.0 | `graphcode-windows/provider-pins.json` |
| Winghostty | `f5abc059e4ca58b376eb209313aca7784659c679` | `graphcode-windows/provider-pins.json` |
| zmx | `11e20c738b4ebd88031c7a01f1a9d938ee123234` | `graphcode-windows/provider-pins.json` |

If a build fails because a tool is missing or the wrong version, rerun
bootstrap. Do not fall back to whatever is on `PATH`.

### The Swift toolchain trap

`swift` on `PATH` is usually **not** the pinned toolchain, and a mismatched
toolchain fails against the `swift-tools-version: 6.0` manifest. Always use
`$env:GRAPHCODE_SWIFT633`, or the pinned toolchain's `bin` directory, rather
than a bare `swift`.

Two failure modes cost real time, so recognize them:

- **`swift --version` exits with `0xC0000139`
  (`STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND`).** The toolchain `usr\bin` is on `PATH` but
  the matching `Runtimes\<version>\usr\bin` is not. Add both, and prefer
  invoking `swift-build.exe` / `swift-test.exe` directly over the `swift`
  driver.
- **A development / "unknown-Asserts" toolchain under
  `C:\Library\Developer\Toolchains` wins on `PATH`.** It is not the pinned
  toolchain. Ignore it.

A working SwiftPM environment needs `SDKROOT` pointing at the pinned
`Platforms\<version>\Windows.platform\Developer\SDKs\Windows.sdk`, plus MSVC
`INCLUDE`/`LIB` for the installed Visual Studio and Windows SDK. Set these
**process-only**; never mutate machine or user environment variables.

### Building and testing

```powershell
# Windows shell (Zig) — run from graphcode-windows
& $env:GRAPHCODE_ZIG0152 test src\<File>.zig --test-filter "<filter>"
& $env:GRAPHCODE_ZIG0152 build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -Dwinghostty-dir=$env:GRAPHCODE_WINGHOSTTY_ROOT

# Repository validation
pwsh -NoProfile -File Tools\windows\validate.ps1 -Task windows-shell -SkipTrayLive
pwsh -NoProfile -File Tools\windows\validate.ps1 -Task packaging
```

Zig test roots that import native headers need explicit target and link flags,
for example:

```
-target x86_64-windows-msvc -lc -luser32 -lgdi32 -ladvapi32 -I<winghostty>\include
```

A `--test-filter` that matches **zero** tests still exits successfully. Always
assert a positive executed test count; a filter typo is not a pass.

New Zig test roots must be registered in `Tools/windows/Tests/WindowsShell.Tests.ps1`,
which derives coverage from literal `& $zig test src\<File>.zig` invocations.

---

## Cross-platform parity

`GraphcodeKit/` is the shared Swift layer, and `Package.resolved` pins
`swift-collections` 1.6.0 and `swift-identified-collections` 1.1.1 for both
platforms. A change there affects the shipping macOS app as well as the port, so
treat it as the highest-risk surface in the repository and validate on both
sides before claiming it is safe.

When building the shared package with the pinned Windows toolchain, use
`--disable-automatic-resolution`. That flag alone can still fetch missing
checkouts, so also set `protocol.allow=never` process-only when you intend a
strictly offline build. If a checkout is genuinely missing, reuse an existing
local one at the exact revision in `Package.resolved` and verify with
`git rev-parse` before building. Never resolve a different version, and never
edit `Package.resolved` to make a build pass.

What parity means, per the ledger: the Windows implementation exposes the same
user-visible information and actions as macOS, with runtime evidence.
Platform-native chrome may differ. What parity does **not** mean: hiding a
feature behind an undocumented shortcut, replacing a structured screen with raw
protocol fields, or a passing Zig unit test standing in for a live walkthrough.
When in doubt, record the row as `Partial` and say why.
